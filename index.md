I am Riccardo Casatta, a Software Engineer that likes to be creative.

I am actually based in Milan, Italy.

My current focus is on [bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org), or should I say blockchain technologies that nowadays sounds better even if I think bitcoin and blockchain are too deeply interconnected to consider one without the other.

* I work for [Blockstream](https://blockstream.com)
* I am the CEO of [Eternity Wall](https://eternitywall.com), started as as side project experimenting with the properties of blockchain with [message lasting forever](https://eternitywall.it) it became a startup focused on Trustless Timestamping (timestamping  without middle-man through the blockchain), working on wannabe international standard called [OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org).
* Associate at [Synaptica](http://synaptica.info) a consultant and software house company.
* Founder at [Assob.it](http://assob.it) an italian association to promote diffusion of blockchain technologies.
* Partner at [Blockchainlab](http://blockchainlab.it) an incubator and research company on blokchain.
